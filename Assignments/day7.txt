----------
1. What are various ways to add images into our App?Explain with examples?
A. Using the import Keyword
-------------------------
You can import a file right in a JavaScript module. This tells a webpack to include 
that file in the bundle. Your code should look like this:

import React from 'react';
import house from './house.png';

const House = ()=>{
return(
<div className="App">
<img src={house} alt="House image height={200} width={200}/>
</div>
)
}
export default House;

Using the require Keyword:
--------------------------
We can also use the require keyword to load the images into your component. In that 
case, your code should look like this:

import React from 'react';

const House = ()=>{
return(
<div className="App">
<img src={require('./house.jpg')} alt="House image"/>
</div>
)
}
export default House;

require can also be used for including audio, video, or document files in your project.
The most common types are .mp3, .wav, .mp4, .mov, .html, and .pdf.

Adding SVGs
------------
One way to add SVG files is described above. You can also import SVGs directly as React 
components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code, it would look like 
this:
import React from 'react';
import House from './house.png';

const House = ()=>{
return(
<div className="App">
<House/>
</div>
)
}
export default House;

This is handy if you don’t want to load the SVG as a separate file. Don’t forget the 
curly braces in the import! The ReactComponent import name is significant and tells Create
React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG rather than its filename.

Adding Network Images:
----------------------
If you are loading images from the network, then it's a pretty straightforward approach.
In your code, it would look like this:

import React from 'react';

const House = ()=>{
return(
<div className="App">
<img src="url"/>
</div>
)
}
export default House;

2. What will happen if we do console.log(useState())?
A. Here on console we will get an array of length 2 .
first one is the default value passed to useState and second is a function().

3. How will useEffect behave if don't add a dependency array?
A.	If we don't pass a dependency array in useEffect hook, then according to it's default
behaviour it will call the effect (callback funtion passed to useEffect) on every 
render of the component in which we are using useEffect. And an empty array passed to 
useEffect will reset its default behaviour and it will call effect only once after The
initial render of component. 

4. What is SPA?
A.	SPA stands for single page application. SPA is a implemention of web application that 
loads a single webdocument, and then updates the body content of that single document using
javascript apis such as fetch and XMLHttpRequest.
This therefore allow users to use website without loading whole new page on very 
interaction or routes.
--------------------------------OR----------------------------
Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates the 
webpage with data from web server without reloading/refreshing the entire page. 
All the HTML, CSS, JS are retrieved in the initial load and other data/resources 
can be loaded dynamically whenever required. An SPA is sometimes referred to as a 
single-page interface (SPI).

5 - What is the differnce between Client side routing and Server side routing?
A.	In Server side routing , when a user click on a link then browser makes an http request
for that pageon server now server process the request and send a response usually a html 
page, now bowser discard the old page and loads the new page.

In client side routing , when use click on a link , now client side code catches the event look for the
the like if the url is not an external then it prevents the browser to make  request.
then routing library changes the url in brwoser with help of html histroy api and routing libary changes
the states and loads component on client side. sometimes if it require client app request data from server
only data not pages, and loads new component on client side.
